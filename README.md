Competitive Auctions on Ebay using R programming language


The file eBayAuctions.csv contains information on 1972 auctions transacted on eBay.com during Mayâ€“June 2004. The goal is to use these data to build a model that will distinguish
competitive auctions from noncompetitive ones. A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least
two bids placed on the item being auctioned. The data include variables that describe the item (auction
category), the seller (his or her eBay rating), and the auction terms that the seller selected (auction duration,
opening price, currency, day of week of auction close). In addition, we have the price at which the auction
closed. The goal is to predict whether or not an auction of interest will be competitive.
